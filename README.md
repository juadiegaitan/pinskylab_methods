### [genomics](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics)

This folder contains subfolders and guides to help lab members working
with bioinformatics.  
    
    - A guide to how we used ABC with SNPs for summer flounder can be found [here](https://github.com/pinskylab/genomics/blob/master/manuals/Guide%20to%20performing%20ABC%20using%20SNP%20data.md).

### [laboratory](https://github.com/pinskylab/laboratory)

This folder contains subfolders and guides to help lab members working
in the wet laboratory, especially with sequencing library preparation.

### [labmgt](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods/tree/master/labmgt)

This folder contains protocols for general lab management, for example
how to create backups.

### [cookbook.md](https://github.com/pinskylab/pinskylab_methods/blob/master/cookbook.md)

This file gives tips and tricks for how Pinsky Lab Members have overcome
obstacles related to data science. The struggle is real\!
